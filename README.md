# Texture-Synthesis-with-GANs

## Overview

We have looked at the problem of texture synthesis using approaches such as that of Gatys et al, where we attempt a gradient descent on random images to encourage the correlations of a CNNs features to resemble that of the desired texture. Another reasonable approach to this problem is to use a GAN to produce random examples of textures.

## Objective

The objective of this project will be to implement a GAN which is capable of producing an output texture of any size. For this, the students will be guided by the work of Jetchev et al. who provide algorithmic details to implement such an architecture. Experiments exploring the advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared with the work of Gatys will be carried out.
